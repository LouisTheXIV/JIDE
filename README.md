# JIDE
Json IDE made with Python tkinter!

# Features
Syntax Highlighting, Auto Indentation, basic text editor features, JSON syntax support, and even more.

# Plans
Add a settings menu (you can edit settings in editor/data/config.json if you want to).
Add more items on the menu bar.
Add plugin support (so you can code your own plugins)!

# How to run
Run the jide.py file using Python 3.6+! You need to pip install TKlighter and make sure you have tkinter installed (it should come preinstalled with Python).
I will make a compiled executable when I finish this program.
